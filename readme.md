### What are going to do?
I am going to write a Chrome extension, __PageMarker__.
Yes, like [diigo](www.diigo.com), PageMarker will be a tool for web pages marking, as what you want to do. 
Importantly, markers, which you have made when you read in the past, would help you understand a read-out article better and quicker.
I mean, reading web pages would be like you are reading you local PDF or word files. 
One word, it would be like another [diigo](www.diigo.com). 
Er, it would be little weaker than [diigo](www.diigo.com).
HaHa, :> 
Insteresting? I am just doing it.

### Materials
Nine months ago, one insight of page editing or marking came into my mind.
Six months ago, I tried [diigo](www.diigo.com). It looks perfect, and I like it very much. As a free user, I used out the first-500 editing chances within a short time. Largely, [diigo](www.diigo.com) satisfies me very much.
I didn't pay it when chances were used out.

One months ago, I wanted to have a try to write such an Chrome extension.

Two days ago--2017-01-13,  the winter holiday was coming.

Even though I had no any idea on Chrome extension development, I just want to have a try.

So, PageMarker, a repository hosted on [Github](www.github.com:cnzero/PageMarker) was built.
Not only main codes of PageMarker will be in such a repository, reading materials, open-source codes that I read, and summary I make, will be included here.

Firstly, it is a insteresting learning experience.
Secondly, codes will work.
